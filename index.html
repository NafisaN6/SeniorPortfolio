        <h3>My name is Nafisa Nawshin and I am a Senior student in Programming and Protoyping at Thomas Edison CTE High School. 
            With my growing interest in coding, I have made this Portfolio so I have everything that I need together, in one easy-to-navigate way! 
            I like spending my free time reading different stories as well as journaling about my day. My journey as a web developer was not a linear one, as I faced a lot of difficulties when trying to learn the complex language
        of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. In the end, perseverance had helped me throughout the way and led me to become the amazing developer that I am today!</h3>

 <center><h2>Reflection</h2></center>
        <h3>While there had been a lot of ups and downs this year, I was able to connect socially with a lot of my peers and even mentors through the InfyApp challenge, learn how to create a functional app through G4C and gain a lot of Python knowledge as well as get my HTML & CSS certification! The InfyApp Challenge had taken up a lot of my year, and while at first there had been some challenges with communication between me and my teammates--especially since we didn't know each other that much in the beginning of the year--we were able to combat that and learn how to work together very well by the end of the year. Things had also been awkward with our mentors at first, but thankfully that changed quickly and I started to feel more comfortable speaking up to my mentors and I loved listening to their adivce and stories as they would always phrase it in a fun and interesting way! Even though my team couldnt win the semifinals, I'm still glad for everything we were able to experience together. 
        Python had also been a challenge, as while it seemed easy at first, I quickly learned that Python was challenging and there was a lot that went into it that I hadn't expected at first! Though despite that, I pushed through and was able to learn a good amount of Python through the way. This year was definently not easy, but I'm glad for all the things I was able to learn along the way!</h3>
